# units_converter_gui

an GUI project that allows the user to convert weird measure units (inches and pounds) to real world units (centimeters and kilograms). A cool challenge about this project was to find out how to refresh the result's label everytime the user change the unit within the combobox.

SKILLS:
  - tkinter library(e.g: windows, labels, combobox, button)
  - .bind function
